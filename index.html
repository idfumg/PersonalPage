          <p>My goal is to learn a new as much as possible. I like C/C++ language. It's robust, reliable code. I like Python language also for Its simplicity and very high human readability. I like Linux and its style of organisation. I try to improve my programming skills every time to achieve more readable, robust code. I am interest in disributed systems and a service style architecture.</p>

          <h4>Komtex-N</h4>
          <p>I am work at Komtex-N since 2013 - now.
It is a company that make programing systems for civil airlines and a railway. This systems work 24*7*365 and written in C++. When I come to the team, I start to develop a new project for railway tickets reservation. This project had base working functionality, already. After a few months I start to develop the project by myself with worthwhile advices of my chief. I learn a lot of new here. I learn quite a bit of functional programming, stateless code design, pure functions, to be constant as much as possible and an accordingly ideology. Every time I write code I try to refactor it to achieve more readability, robust and reliable code. This helps me to increase my programming skills. I rewrite most of existing code of my project. I wanted to give good, readable code to everyone who wants to read it. In the company I have a deal with C++, Python, Oracle SQL database, many functional style code, cooperation by HTTP of several remoted systems.

          <h4>NewTeleSystems</h4>
          <p>I worked at NTS (New Tele Systems) in 2011-2012. It is an Internet provider company. It was open a new department which goal was development a commutator device like Cisco devices (with Cisco ALU). When I come to team our guys developed hardware scheme and start to write C++ programming code for main device daemon. They use a contract with the Cisco company for getting their ALU source codes. My goal was emplementing a web service daemon for setting up a device by a browser. I've been realize a main web service daemon which used the mongoose web server and communicate with a main device daemon by XMLRPC protocol for a device control. All this was written in C++. We can't allow us some modern scripting languages like Python, Perl, PHP, due to constraints of the device memory. I've learned there several languages like Javascript, CSS, HTML, Jquery for a web page implementation. The feature of the page was it's a mostly dynamic nature. I am not become a professional web developer of course, but I've been obtain common knowledge about a subject and I was performing tasks assigned to me. In my spare time I read about some web design or jquery features for make my design and functionality better. The web page in a final stage be able to fully control a device like a command like interface. The device was embedded in a current working network to many houses over the city.</p>
